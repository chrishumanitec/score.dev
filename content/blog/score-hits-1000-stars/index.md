Thank you to everyone participating in this open-source community for this fantastic result! 

We are excited to work harder and build with our contributors. That’s why we launched the [discussion tab](https://github.com/score-spec/spec/discussions) in GitHub. There, you can share your questions and feedback.

On Wednesday, December 7th, our project will be featured in a [Twitter Space](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1lPJqBDQwolxb?s=20) with Platform Engineering’s Community Manager Luca Galante (@luca_cloud), Score’s Product Manager Susa Tuenker (@_sujaya), Civo Cloud’s DevRel Manager Kunal Kushwaha (@kunalstwt), Wix’s Senior DevOps Engineer Hila Fish (@Hilafish1), and Upbound’s Developer Advocate Viktor Farcic (vfarcic). Join “[One YAML to rule them all](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1lPJqBDQwolxb?s=20)” to learn more about workload specifications, cognitive load and Score. 

We can’t wait to keep on building our journey!
